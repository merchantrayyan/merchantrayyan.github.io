<p>Currently, my main objective is to obtain final sets of data to analyze, so much of this week was spent doing final adjustments to my models. Based on a suggestion from Dr. Tang, I looked at minimizing the size of the model embeddings, which would allow the model to train faster. To my surprise, doing so resulted in a model with similar levels of accuracy, which will help me out a lot if I need to retrain a set of models. An unfortunate part of doing ML research is the large amount of training time necessary to obtain a good set of results. As the data the model is trained on drastically affects the model’s performance, best practice generally means that your model’s performance is actually an average of the performance of several models trained on different data splits. As a result, I’ve been running a lot of models in the background as I work on the literature review for my writeup.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I’ve been spending my time trying to enjoy local spots I feel that I’ve missed out on due to travelling. I visited several parks this week just to relax, and trying a number of new food spots, which is where I got the incredibly tasty kimbap and dumplings I’m holding in the photo below.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m currently in Berlin, a place I’ve wanted to visit for over a year now. I took Friday off work and headed here for the weekend. While here, I (of course) made a few stops to view some carillons, but I was only able to play the one in the Tiergarten. One of them, in the Französischer Dom, is a super strange instrument as its almost entirely enclosed, meaning its very hard to actually hear the bells from the outside, and extremely loud in the tower itself.</p>

<p>In terms of research, my work has mostly been the same since yesterday, with further testing for model training parameters. However, as most of this is done now, I’m looking into other ways of showing model accuracy such as a confusion matrix. This would help me visualize which letters are being incorrectly transliterated by the model the most.</p>

<p>As my two-month lease ended on the 7th, I had to move out of my temporary home that day as well. Luckily, the post-doc in our lab was out the entire week for a conference, and was happy to let me sleep on his couch for the week while he was away. Even more luckily, he lived about a 5 minute walk away from my apartment, meaning I was able to stay in the Bilk neighborhood that I’ve grown to love.</p>

<p>As this was my last full week (I left Germany on the 15th), there was not much work being done, mainly planning for when I got back. As a result of German holidays/exam period and the aforementioned conference, most of the department was gone, and so it was also quite silent during the workday. Nevertheless, I continued working on my writeup, although since the deadline was recently changed to the end of August, I was no longer quite so stressed as I had been before.</p>

<p>For the weekend, I headed to Aachen to see my friends one last time before I left, although due to the university exam period, we all ended up just working together rather than doing any sort of activities. Still, it was a great last trip to round out my summer in Germany.</p>

<p>On Monday, we had a laboratory dinner for me before I headed back to the USA early Tuesday morning, and it was wonderful final sendoff for my time in Düsseldorf. I really feel as though I understand what it means to conduct NLP research on a professional level, from project formation to submission, and I’m truly grateful to CURBS for allowing me to experience this through SUIRP. Even more importantly, the time I spent in Germany has allowed me to bring my thesis project to a level of completion I never would have been able to reach if I had done this work during the semester. Overall, it’s been an incredible time, and now that I’m back in the USA, I’m excited to continue refining my work and submit my final thesis in time for graduation in December.</p>

<p>As I approach the last three weeks, my tasks have definitely become more writeup-focused. I’m still working with the HPC to test  the effects of a greater batch size, and I’m also refining the metrics I’m using to evaluate my model. There are two ways to evaluate my work, its raw accuracy and general comprehensibility, and the second is definitely a lot more difficult to translate to technical terms. As the results of my work need to be made clear to non-Persian speakers, this adds another layer of difficulty to the process of deciding which metrics are most appropriate.</p>

<p>This week, one of my friends from my exchange was in the city to see family, so we went to the Düsseldorfer Kirmes, the local fair, which was right on the river and packed. German town fairs seem to have a wider variety of foods available, and many different places to get beer as well, which was quite interesting.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I finally took the trip to the relatively nearby city of Arnhem, where I played the carillon located in the Eusebius Church. The church had a very cool all-glass outlook that you could step onto, and it had a great view of the city.</p>

<p>This week, I began working on the writeup for my submission due on the 15th, and discovered the implementing foreign orthographies in Overleaf is a bit of a pain. After some time, I was able to get fonts for both Tajik Cyrillic (basically Russian with additional letters) and Perso-Arabic (basically Arabic with additional letters) working. This allowed me to include actual examples (glosses) in my writeup. As my work deals with the many differences between orthograhies, showing as many examples as possible in each script is extremely important.</p>

<p>I also started working more with the HPC, the supercomputer at Heinrich-Heine University, as I required more computing power than I was able to tap into with the lab machine at UF that I was remotely accessing. In my meeting with Dr. Tang last week, I brought in relevant literature from related research papers that showed that implementing a higher batch size when training our model would likely lead to better results. If the HPC works as it should, this should lead to better results.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, I was also able to play for a fourth time in Venlo, as the carillonneur was unexpectedly unable to play that week. As this was my last week, I made sure to stop by the store ‘Zwei Brüder’, which had tons of deals that attract Germans there every week. I made sure to pick up some souvenirs for my parents, including some Douwe Egberts coffee and limited edition Fanta-flavored Mentos.</p>

<p>Later in the day, I headed to ZAKK Halle to see one of my favorite bands, Men I Trust, live in concert! I had been able to hear them last year in Cologne, and it was a great experience to see them again in Düsseldorf on their only German stop of the European tour.</p>

<p>After the packed weeks I had, this week was actually the exact opposite, as I started feeling a bit stuck. Although I knew what I needed to do and what my next steps were, I did feel very little motivation to get things done. Luckily, a meeting with Dr. Tang reoriented me in the right direction, and I feel a lot more secure in the steps I am taking right now. There’s still quite a bit of (self-imposed) pressure as I have a deadline to meet on August 15th (the day my flight leaves Germany), but I do feel that I’ll be able to make the deadline as long as I keep at it.</p>

<p>Besides research, I have a few notable memories from this week:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This enormous plate of curry chicken katsu that I accidentally ordered in Düsseldorf’s Little Tokyo.</li>
  <li>Seeing local signs in Düsseldorfer Platt (the local variety of Plattdeutsch) in random places around town. As a linguist, it’s always cool to see the local linguistic heritage being retained despite German being the official language for so long. I took a picture of a sign in the mall near me, see if you can see a difference between that and German!</li>
  <li>Playing the carillon in Venlo for a wedding, which I’ve never done before (the UF policy is to not play wedding songs otherwise people will ask us for them all the time)</li>
  <li>All the trains from Venlo (NL) to Germany being cancelled for the rest of day, and waiting for a replacement bus that came 2 hours late (thank you Deutsche Bahn). It took me two hours (instead of 50 minutes) to get home.</li>
</ul>

<p>After an busy weekend playing carillons in Venlo and Emmerich (and travelling to and from there), I was definitely ready for a calmer week spent working in the lab.
As the TaCoS conference (Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierende) was taking place at HHU this week, I spent much of my time preparing for my presentation. I had already given a similar talk
at NACIL in April, but included some more new information/data obtained through my research over the past few weeks. Since the conference was also more technology-focused than the last, 
I got more into the nitty-gritty of our model architecture, and focused less on some of the linguistic challenges. I got a lot of good feedback as well as the chance to meet linguistics students from all over Germany
(there was even a guy from Minnesota!). On the weekend, I went back to Venlo on Saturday to play while the normal carilloneur was away, before heading to Brussels for a day trip on Sunday! While my time there was a little short, 
I tried to fit in as many touristy things as possible.</p>

<p>This week, I’ve mainly been preoccupying myself with cleaning up and improving my code that I had written so far to test my model. Due to the fact that I had been so busy with school, my previous methods of training and evaluation were quite sloppy, as I had wanted to get reportable results quickly for my LSA poster and talk at NACIL. Unfortunately, that haphazard approach has definitely bitten me in the butt, and I’m now paying for the price for it. While I know this work is necessary, it certainly seems like one of those tasks that has a small payoff in relation to the hours sunk in. Nevertheless, I’m pushing on.</p>

<p>Besides work, this week has been one full of travel and carillon playing for me. On Wednesday, I took a trip to Liege, Belgium to play two historic carillons that I unfortunately had never played despite living 30 minutes away from them last year. These were the first two carillons I’ve played on this trip, and getting used to the European-style console (again) along with the unique sounding bells proved to be a challenge. On Saturday, I took a trip to Venlo in the Netherlands to play one of my favorite carillons in Europe. To my surprise, the carilloneur there offered to give me the keys while he was away on vacation the next two weeks, an offer which I readily took up. As such, I’ll be heading to Venlo for the next two Saturdays to perform for a whole hour with as a large (and unwilling?) audience in the Saturday market in the town below. Afterwards on Sunday, I took a trip to Emmerich am Rhein in Germany, to play the carillon there. Due to construction on the railways around Oberhausen, the trip there and back took much longer than usual, but it was nonetheless rewarding (although I might not make that journey again soon).</p>

<p>While I thought I had overcome my jet lag while I was in Aachen, it came back with a vengeance this week, which prevented me from getting to the office as early as I wanted. Luckily, I’m able to choose my own hours as long as I get my work done, so I made up for it by staying late most times.</p>

<p>Following the research plan I set up last week, I continued my work on my thesis project involving machine transliteration between Tajik Persian and Iranian/Afghan Persian (<a href="https://merchantrayyan.github.io/projects/translit_project/">more info. here!</a>). My current goal is to work on improving my model’s accuracy in time for my talk “Machine Transliteration between two Persian Dialects - The Case of Farsi and Tajiki” that I will be giving at the <a href="https://tacosconference.github.io/">Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierenden (TaCoS)</a>, taking place at Heinrich-Heine University from June 29th to July 2nd. This conference takes place at a different university in Germany (or the Netherlands) every year, and is attended by Computational Linguistics students and professors from across the region. I’ll be taking part as one of the twelve student talks. There’s a lot of fascinating work on display that shows the interdisciplinary breadth of Computational Linguistics, with research involving Parkinson’s Disease, Shakespeare, and even language revitalization on display, so I’m quite excited to attend!</p>

<p>To round off the week, I finally visited the main tourist attraction: the Rhein Promenade, and stumbled upon the Düsseldorfer Büchermeile (Düsseldorf Book Mile), a book fair held only three times a year! I spent a couple of hours perusing the many stalls, and ended up going home with some Asterix and Obelix books (my favorite comics growing up), some bilingual short stories to improve my German, the Greek novel “Alexis Sorbas” (in German), and a Dä Bläck Fööss vinyl record (they’re a locally-famous band that sings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colognian">Kölscher (Cologne) variety of Plattdeutsch</a>, a Germanic language separate from standard German).</p>

<p>Early Wednesday morning, I arrived in Frankfurt full of anticipation for the summer ahead that even a “random check” from the airport police couldn’t curb. After jumping on an ICE train to Düsseldorf and checking into my apartment, I immediately went to Heinrich-Heine University, my new workplace for the next ten weeks. Although I came towards the end of the workday, I was able to reunite with my fellow labmates whom I had previously met last year, as well as some new faces. I also got a chance to tour the newly-furnished laboratory space, which includes a phonetics recording booth! Unfortunately, after that it was clear that the jet lag was catching up to me, so I headed back home to sleep. Luckily for my, Thursday was a holiday, so I was able to sleep the whole day away, which left me full of energy for Friday.</p>

<p>As Friday was my first real day, I still had a bit of adjustment to do, so I was shown around more of the building as well as introduced to some of the procedures. The main item on my agenda however, was my meeting with my thesis supervisor, Dr. Kevin Tang. We discussed the current status of my thesis research, along with further steps and the publications to which we plan to submit our papers.</p>

<p>After a fruitful meeting and quick selfie for the blog, I was off to Aachen to see the friends I had made during my semester exchange with RWTH Aachen last spring. While there,Not only was I able to see my friends, but I visited all the familiar landmarks I used to frequent while living there (including the Aachener Rathaus below). We even had time to go visit Aachen’s Kletterwald (literally “climbing forest”), where I ziplined and tackled obstacle courses high among the trees. The day ended with a dorm grill party on the balcony, before I headed back to Düsseldorf to begin my first full week at work.</p>

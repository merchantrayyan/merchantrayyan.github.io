Hello! I'm a fourth (and a half) year undergraduate at the University of Florida, double-majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics. My current research projects and interests generally revolve around utilizing NLP/computational linguistics for social good, with a focus on low-resource languages. Some languages I work with/are interested in are: (Tajik) Persian, Spanish, Konkani, and Hindi/Urdu.

At UF, I've been fortunate enough to work under the supervision of [Dr. Kevin Tang](https://kevintang.org/) in the [Speech, Lexicon, and Modeling Laboratory](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/). Our work has focused on machine transliteration between two different Persian scripts, as well as computational analysis of Spanish dialectal variation.

I'm currently conducting research at [Heinrich-Heine
Universität](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/) with Dr. Tang, funded by the [SUIRP scholarship](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/suirp/) from [UF's Center for Undergraduate Research](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/). Check out my journal [here](https://merchantrayyan.github.io/blog/)!

Outside of research, I volunteer with the [Samuel Proctor Oral History Program](https://oral.history.ufl.edu/), and play the [carillon](https://arts.ufl.edu/sites/carillon-studio/welcome/) located in UF's Century Tower under the tutelage of [Dr. Laura Ellis](https://arts.ufl.edu/sites/carillon-studio/welcome/). I've also received instruction from [Luc Rombouts](https://beiaardschool.mechelen.be/about-us/luc-rombouts) of the [Belgian Royal Carillon School](https://beiaardschool.mechelen.be/en).

Carillons I've played:
